in the project directory run:
heroku create

spits out a URL
heroku open will go to the URL

still need to deploy
need to add git remotes

run
git remote -v
should see remotes for heroku and github
the heroku remote might be for a different project (ie, smart-brain)

heroku git:remote -a "name of new app" - ie, the URL from above

git remote -v should show the new remote configured for the new app

git push heroku master will now push local code and install dependencies

heroku open??? hmmm
dev dependencies don't get installed

heroku logs --tail for info about what went wrong

need to bring port in as an environmental variable
in ther server file, change the port to
process.env.PORT || 3000

remember, any changes, you gotta:
git add. git commit git push heroku master

it'll redeploy the server, installing dependencies etc

heroku logs --tails
